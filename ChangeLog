	clach04@ca.com changes

	Added code to set description to an empty list.
	Changed getsid() code to NOT check sqlcode but to check sid instead
	I think it is a mistake to check the sqlcode (e.g. try droping a table
	that does not exist, then inquire_ingres to get the session id and
	then check the sqlcode, it will have the drop error and not be zero).

	To after debug statements to aid in debugging

Mon Apr 12 13:20:00 PST 2004 - change to version 1.2
	clach04@ca.com changes

	Added session id to to cursor object
	This allows multiple sessions to work correctly, previously
	execute was NOT setting the session id was was using the current
	(de-)active session. Even for single threaded applications.

	Added a few simple test scripts that deal with multiple sessions.

	Thread-Safe code added (note threadsafety attribute left alone):

		EXEC SQL set connection none;
        to allow esql/c programs using threads to share DBMS connections.

	Added set session and unset session code around pretty much all
			EXEC SQL code
	I was thinking of creating wrapper routine around the original code
	BUT I decided that it was "nicer" to add the session switching AFTER
	some of the sanity checks (e.g. no point in setting the session IF
	the arguments to the function are not passed in correctly). Wrappers
	would have been neater (and are still possible) but I went with 
	peppering the source with set/unset code. Note there are more
	unset session calls due to the need to unset before each return(....) 
	after errors (wrappers would avoid that).

	Removed oldsid code from close connection code as it didn't work 100%
	new set session code on all calls should remove the need for this any
	way

	Minor change to debug output string when debug turned on
	(verbose->debug)

	Removed INGMOD_DEBUG define from ingmod.ec, this should be set
	at build time in the makefile/build script.

	Removed debug/version info from test script.

	clach04@ca.com changes

	Renamed :switchexec to switchexec and modified readme's and makefile
	:switchexec is not a valid filename under windows.

	Modified Makefile to use OS variables.

	Modified Makefile to pass in (2.5) "-multi" parameter to esqlc

	Created build shell script to feed variables into Makefil, used
	under RedHat AS 3.0 with Python 2.2.3

	Modified esql/c code to:
		Export dll symbols so that ingmod can be used under Windows.

		Added ifdefs around snprintf as this isn't easily available
		under windows, use the less afe sprintf instead.

		Remove "PyObject_HEAD_INIT(&PyType_Type)" inits for datatypes
		and replaces with (Python Cookbook 2.1) recommended approach
		of "PyObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL)" followed by init at
		module/function call time. This was required to build under 
		Windows (and I believe newer/stricter versions of GNU gcc).

		Add NT build batch file "dll_build.bat".

	hm, incorporate Richard Béneyt's patch:

	2003/07/06 - Richard Béneyt (rbeneyt@free.fr) - in sqlda_input_bind(...):
		Fixed "tuple index out of range" exception occurring sometimes
		:( after a cursor.execute(stmt). 
		Needed PyErr_Clear() when PySequence_GetItem(seq, num) failed 
		at the end of the sequence.
