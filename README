This is an Python Database API 2.0 conforming CA Ingres modul. It is
totally written in ESQL/C. It was tested with following Ingres
Versions:

	CA OpenIngres 1.2 on SUN Solaris 2.6
	CA Ingres II Linux on PC SuSE Linux 6.3

And to some extent with:

	CA Ingres 6.4 on SUN Solaris 2.5

Especially Binary() and DATA HANDLERS don't work with Ingres 6.4.

The module adds some extensions to the API 2.0.  Please read Extensions
for a detailed description.

Installation: please go thru Makefile and adjust to Your environment.
Per default, a shared module is build. In ingtest.py, set DB to a
reasonable value (default DB is "iidbdb"). Data handler don't work with
Ingres 6.4.  Use switchexec <ingmod.ec >ingmod64.ec to patch the
module for use with Ingres 6.4.  The ESQL/C compiler complains about
unknown EXEC statements (even when they are within comments).

Windows notes
=============

Known to build with Python 2.1.3.

Needs MS VC++ version 6 minimum (or what ever was used to create the python
distribution).

dll_build.bat is a batch file to build a win32 dll. It needs to be edited to 
include the batch file to call to setup the path, etc. to use the MS compiler.
Needs MS VC++ version 6 minimum

Unix (Linux) notes
==================

build.sh is a shell script for buiding under RedHat AS 3.0. Known to work
with Python 2.1 and 2.2 (Python 2.2.3 x86 for RedHat AS 3.0). It needs to
be modified to contain the location of python, etc. before it can be
called to build the shared libary for ingmod.
